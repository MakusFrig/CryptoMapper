# CryptoMapper
CryptoMapper is a python tool for learning about stocks over extended periods of time. It uses webscraping to retrieve csv files from yahoo finance, tkinter as the gui framework, and python as the language it's programmed in. Enjoy seeing the history of your preferred stocks in our high contrast theme
